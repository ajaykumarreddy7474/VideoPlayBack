A 'video playback' design was created using Figma, a UI/UX design tool.

Using Figma, I created an interactive prototype showcasing the video playback interface.
Include transitions and interactions to demonstrate the flow of the user experience.

Designed wireframe for the video playback interface. Consider play/pause controls,
progress bars, volume controls, and fullscreen mode. Ensure the design is user-friendly
and intuitive.

Uploaded (.fig) files and  provided links for those Wireframes and prototypes:
